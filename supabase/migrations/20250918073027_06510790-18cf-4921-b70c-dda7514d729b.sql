-- Update the profiles table to work with Clerk authentication
-- Remove the foreign key constraint that references auth.users since we're using Clerk
-- and update the RLS policies to work with our custom user IDs

-- First, let's check the current structure and update the profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_user_id_fkey;

-- Update RLS policies to work with our custom UUID system
-- We need to ensure the policies allow operations based on our supabaseUserId

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- Create new policies that work with our Clerk UUID mapping
-- Since we're using Clerk auth, we can't use auth.uid(), so we'll allow operations
-- based on the user_id column matching the authenticated user's mapped UUID

-- For now, we'll create more permissive policies and handle security in the application layer
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Note: In a production environment, you'd want more restrictive policies
-- but since we're using Clerk auth with UUID mapping, we handle security at the app level
